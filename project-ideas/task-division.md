   - Document the purpose of functions and variables in the code.
   - Ensure the code is well-documented for future reference and maintainability.



**GitHub Repository Structure:**

- **main** (production-ready branch)
- **development** (for ongoing development)
- **staging** (beta-snake branch for testing and integration)
- **HTML/** (folder for HTML files)
- **CSS/** (folder for CSS files)
- **JS/** (folder for JavaScript files)
- **Images/** (folder for game assets)
- **Docs/** (folder for documentation)
